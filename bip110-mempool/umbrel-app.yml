version: "3.2.1"
port: 3026
description: >-
  A specialized fork of the Mempool block explorer that visualizes BIP-110
  (Reduced Data Temporary Softfork) related activity on the Bitcoin network.


  BIP-110 proposes restricting certain rarely-used script features to reduce
  the maximum possible block validation data from ~4GB to ~400KB per block,
  making Bitcoin more resilient and easier to run on modest hardware.


  Features:

  • Highlights blocks from miners signaling BIP-110 support with green/gold
  celebratory visuals

  • Identifies transactions that would violate BIP-110 consensus rules with
  neon orange warning indicators

  • Detects all 7 BIP-110 rule violations: large scriptPubKeys, large
  PUSHDATA/witness elements, undefined witness versions, taproot annex,
  large control blocks, OP_SUCCESS, and OP_IF/OP_NOTIF in tapscripts

  • Full Mempool explorer functionality including mempool visualization,
  block explorer, transaction details, and mining dashboard


  Based on Mempool v3.2.1. Requires a fully synced Bitcoin node.
